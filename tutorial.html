        <h2>What is Nx?</h2>
        <p>Nx is a high level compiled general purpose programming made in batch file.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>to display text on the screen in Nx you have to write print and the string</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>print hello</p>
        <p>the above line of code will display hello on the terminal</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h2>wait</h2>
        <p>wait is a command in Nx which is simmilar to pause in batch file.</p>
        <p>if you have written print hello it prints hello on the screen but after it it immediately exits for preventing it from immediately exiting we write wait</p>
        <p>If we have written wait it shows press any key to continue... and after we have pressed anykey on the keyboard it exits</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h2>Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables are data values that can change when the user is asked a question, for example, their age. Variables may change during program execution. A variable is a memory location . ... When data is read from a variable, the content of the memory location is copied and used in calculations.
            </p>
            <p>their are 3 data types in Nx</p>
            <p><strong>they are: </strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>string</li>
                <li>float</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can make a vriable by writing its type and then its name then its value</p>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>int b=78</p>
            <p>string c=hello</p>
            <p>float d=4.7</p>
            <p>You cant make variables with the names a and printstring</p>
    </div>


    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>To take user input in Nx you have to write input and then the name of the variable</p>
        <h4>Example: </h4>
        <p>input a=</p>
        <p>The above line of code will take user input in the a variable</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">    
        <h2>Maths</h2>
        <p>You can do simple mathematical equations in Nx like plus, minus, multiply, divide</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>int a 1+1</p>
        <p>int a 2-1</p>
        <p>int a 2*4</p>
        <p>int a 6/2</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myclass">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand, and are generally ignored by compilers and interpreters.</p>
        <p>You can write single line comments with :: in Nx and multi line comments /**/</p>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>::this is a single comment</p>
        <p>/*this is a</p>
        <p>multi line comment*/</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h2>loops</h2>
        <p>There are 3 types of loops in Nx.</p>
        <p>They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>while loop</li>
            <li>do-while loop</li>
            <li>for loop</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>While loop</h3>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>while 1==1</p>
        <p>print hello</p>
        <p>endloop</p>
        <p>If the condition that is written after the while is false then the code inside it will run if the condition is true the loop will end.</p>
        <p>To end the loop write endloop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>do-while</h3>
        <p>Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in Nx checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.

        A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.</p>
        
        <p>Example:</p>

        <p>do </p>
        <p>print 1</p>
        <p>dwhile false</p>

    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>for loop</h3>
        <p>there are many types of for loops in Nx.</p>
        <p>They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>for.list which is equivalent to for /l in batch.</li>
            <li>file.scan which is equivalent to for /r in batch.</li>
            <li>str.scan which is equivalent to for /f in batch.</li>
            <li>for which is equivalent to for in batch.</li>
            <li>dir.scan which is equivalent to for /d in batch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to learn about any type of for loop just search for their batch version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>If statement</h3>
        <p>An if statement is a programming conditional statement that, if proved true, performs a function or displays information.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>if %b%==1 print the value of b is 1.</p>
        <p>if %b%==1 (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is 1.</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>You can write more than one line of code that should be executed if the condition is true by ().</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>All the comparison operators:</h3>
        <p>"==" - Equal</p>
        <p>"EQU" - Equal/numeric equal</p>
        <p>"NEQ" - Not equal</p>
        <p>"LSS" - Less than</p>
        <p>"LEQ" - Less than or equal</p>
        <p>"GTE" - Greater than</p>
        <p>"GEQ" - Greater than or equal</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>Other kinds of if statements</h3>
        <p>ifExist</p>
        <p>The ifExist statement checks if a file exists</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>ifExist b.txt print b.txt exists</p>
        <p>The above line of code will check if a file named b.txt exists and if it exists it will print b.txt exits.</p>
        <p>ifDefined</p>
        <p>The ifDefined statement checks if a variable is defined.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>ifDefined b print b is defined</p>
        <p>The above line of code will check if a variable named b is defined and if its defined then it will print b is defined.</p>
        <p>ifNot</p>
        <p>The ifNot statement will check if the condition is not true and if it is not true it will execute the code</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>ifNot b==12 (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is not equal to 12</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>The above line of code will check if the value of a variable named b is equal to 12 and then if it is nbot equal to 12 then it will print the value of b is not equal to 12</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>else</h3>
        <p>In programming languages, an else statement is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous test condition evaluates to false.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>if %b%==1 (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is 1</p>
        <p>) else (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is not 1</p>
        <p>)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>else if</h3>
        <p>A elseif statement is a conditional statement that is like a if statement but runs if the previous if statement is false and it is true.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>if %b%==1 (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is 1.</p>
        <p>) elseif %b%==2 (</p>
        <p>print the value of b is 2</p>
        <p>)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are a set of instructions bundled together to achieve a specific outcome. Functions are a good alternative to having repeating blocks of code in a program.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>func b</p>
        <p>print hello</p>
        <p>endfunc</p>
        <p>You can call the function anywhere in your program by the keyword call and then the name of function to excute the code written inside it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>parameters in functions</h3>
        <p>Parameters allow us to pass information or instructions into functions and procedures . They are useful for numerical information such as stating the size of an object. Parameters are the names of the information that we want to use in a function or procedure. The values passed in are called arguments.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>call showWeight "34"</p>
        <p>function showWeight</p>
        <p>So your wait is %1</p>
        <p>endfunc</p>
        <p>%1 is the first parameter and %2 second and so on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>labels</h3>
        <p>Labels helps you to jump to a state or pass parameters to execute tasks (somewhat procedural programming).        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>label c</p>
        <p>print hello</p>
        <p>goto c</p>
        <p>With the goto statement you can go to the label and again execute the code after it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>File IO</h3>
        <h4>Write in a file</h4>
        <p>To write in a file you have to write print then whatever you want to store in that file and then >> and then the file name with file extension.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>print hello >> b.txt</p>
        <p>The above line of code will make a file named b.txt and will write hello inside it.</p>
        <h4>Read from a file</h4>
        <p>To read text from a file you have to file.read then the name of the file.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>file.read b.txt</p>
        <p>The above line of code will read the text of b.txt which we have made earlier and it will print the text inside b.txt</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>key</h3>
        <p>For the user to only press some keys you have to write key and then the keys that you want your user to be able to press.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>key wsad</p>
        <p>With the above line of code the user would be only allowed to press w,s,a or d.</p>
        <p>If you want to check which key he pressed you write ifErrorlevel== and then the key and then the code to be executed if the statement is true.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>key ws</p>
        <p>ifErrorlevel==w print you pressed w</p>
        <p>ifErrorlevel==s print you pressed s</p>
        <p>In the above line of code if you pressed w it will print you pressed w and if you pressed s it will print you pressed s. Note:you can only enter the keys given after the key statement in the above line of code I have given w and s so thge user can only press w or s.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>Header files</h3>
        <p>Header files in nx unlike C/C++ have the same file extension.</p>
        <p>You store code in multiple files by creating header files. Header files are nothing but normal Nx files when we include them to our main file they excutes all the code written inside it.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>print hello</p>
        <p>We have made header file named h.nx and written print hello inside when we will include h.nx it will print hello</p>
        <p>Include a header file</p>
        <p>to include a header file youn have to write #include and then the name of file but with no file extension.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>#include h</p>
        <p>The above line of code will include the header file h.nx which we have earlier remember dont write the file extension while including it. It will print hello world as we have written print hello inside h.nx.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="myclass">
        <h3>Import pre-built libraries</h3>
        <p>There many libraries in Nx to import one you have to write import and then the name of the library.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>import string</p>
        <p>The above line of code will import the string library.</p>
        <h4>Using list</h4>
        <p>import list</p>
        <p>:: Find sum of list of numbers, seperated by a space character. </p>
        <p>sum "variable_name" "list"</p>

        <p>:: Find maximum of list, seperated by a space character.</p>
        <p>max "variable_name" "list"</p>

        <p>:: Find minimum of list, seperated by a space character.</p>
        <p>min "variable_name" "list"</p>

        <p>:: Example:</p>
        <p>max "max_num" "2 3 1 8 5"</p>
        <p>:: This will prints out "8"</p>
        <p>print %max_num%</p>

        <h4>Using array</h4>
        <p>import array</p>

        <p>:: Find sum of every elements in an array</p>
        <p>arrSum "variable_name" "array" "length"</p>

        <p>:: Find largest element in an array</p>
        <p>arrMax "variable_name" "array" "length"</p>

        <p>:: Find smallest element in an array</p>
        <p>arrMin "variable_name" "array" "length"</p>

        <p>:: Example:</p>
        <p>var[] arr[0]=1</p>
        <p>var[] arr[1]=0</p>
        <p>var[] arr[2]=10</p>
        <p>arrMax "max_num" "arr" "3"</p>
        <p>:: This will prints out "10"</p>
        <p>print %max_num%</p>

        <p>Using math</p>
        <p>import math</p>

        <p>odd "variable_name" "number"</p>
            
        <p>:: Check if a number is even</p>
        <p>even "variable_name" "number</p>
            
        <p>:: Power</p>

        <p>toUpperCase "variable_name" "string"</p>
            
        <p>:: To lowercase</p>
        <p>toLowerCase "variable_name" "string"</p>
            
        <p>:: Reverse</p>
        <p>reverse "variable_name" "string"</p>
